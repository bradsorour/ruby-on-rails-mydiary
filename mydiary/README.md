To start the server, run `rails server`. 

The running application will then be available at http://127.0.0.1:3000/

Adding entries to this application can be done at http://localhost:3000/entries

***

To run the Rails console, run `rails console`

Similar to irb, the Rails console allows you to run commands. Unlike irb, Rails console loads the entire Rails environment so that you can access all of the code in your project.
